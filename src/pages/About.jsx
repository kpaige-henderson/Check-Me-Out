                {`Kendall Henderson has spent her career as a teacher by day and teacher by night for many years. She has
                thrived and survived in countless environments that have made her an expert on adversity, adaptability,
                attentive, and amiable. These tools have brought her great success in the teaching world, but she now
                has her sights set on the world of coding and the relativity it has when it comes to being creative and
                problem solving. (things she felt best at in her other world) Kendall has been learning and growing with
                gaining more and more knowledge with html, css, JavaScript, API's, and many more to come. She knows
                there's a vast amount to learn and she is ready to tackle any project that is thrown her way. Please
                take a peak at what she has accomplished thus far, and do not hestistant to shoot any questions or
                inquiries her way. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to visit this page and get to know
                Kendall a little bit more. `}
